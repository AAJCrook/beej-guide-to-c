# beej-guide-to-c
This is a coding companion for Beej's guide to C found here: https://beej.us/guide/bgc/html/split/
Primarily the code will be commented for explanation, but for more difficult concepts that need to be elaborated on or visualized, notes will go in the docs folder.
Sample file structure for this program:\
.\
